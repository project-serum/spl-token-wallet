# SPL Token Wallet

Example Solana wallet with support for [SPL tokens](https://spl.solana.com/token) and Serum integration.

See [sollet.io](https://www.sollet.io) for a demo.

Wallet keys are stored in `localStorage`, optionally encrypted by a password.

Run `yarn start` to start a development server or `yarn build` to create a production build that can be served by a static file server.
